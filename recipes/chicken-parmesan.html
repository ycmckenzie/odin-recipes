  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Chicken parmesan is a dish that consists of breaded chicken breast covered in tomato sauce and mozzarella, parmesan, or provolone cheese. A quantity of ham or bacon is sometimes added.</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>boneless chicken breast</li>
    <li>salt & ground black pepper</li>
    <li>eggs</li>
    <li>bread crumbs</li>
    <li>parmesan cheese</li>
    <li>flour</li>
    <li>olive oil</li>
    <li>tomato sauce</li>
    <li>basil</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat an oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).</li>
    <li>Place chicken breasts between two sheets of heavy plastic (resealable freezer bags work well) on a solid, level surface. Firmly pound chicken with the smooth side of a meat mallet to a thickness of 1/2-inch. Season chicken thoroughly with salt and pepper</li>
    <li>Beat eggs in a shallow bowl and set aside</li>
    <li>Mix bread crumbs and 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese in a separate bowl, set aside</li>
    <li>Place flour in a sifter or strainer; sprinkle over chicken breasts, evenly coating both sides</li>
    <li>Dip a flour-coated chicken breast in beaten eggs. Transfer breast to the bread crumb mixture, pressing crumbs into both sides. Repeat for each breast. Let chicken rest for 10 to 15 minutes</li>
    <li>Heat 1/2 inch olive oil in a large skillet on medium-high heat until it begins to shimmer. Cook chicken in the hot oil until golden, about 2 minutes per side. The chicken will finish cooking in the oven</li>
    <li>Transfer chicken to a baking dish. Top each breast with 2 tablespoons tomato sauce. Layer each chicken breast with equal amounts of mozzarella cheese, fresh basil, and provolone cheese. Sprinkle remaining Parmesan over top and drizzle each with 1/2 teaspoon olive oil</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is browned and bubbly and chicken breasts are no longer pink in the center, 15 to 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
